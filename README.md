* ## Travelling-Salesman-Problem
  - Travelling Salesman Problem is a famous problem such that you want to get
 the smallest path which this salesman can go through such that he visits
 all cities only one time and then returns to the first city again.

- In the code, I initialized many random solution for the route, then through
 many generations, I tried to improve the solutios to get near to the optimal solution,
 and this is the idea of Genetic Algorithms.

* ## Sudoko-Problem
  - There is another code that tries to solve sodoko problem, but it is not
  the perfect one, as sodoke is not easy to solve using GA. I think If the
  parameters or the methods of the GA Operators changed, it will be much possible
  to get to the optimal solution, but tell now, it seldom get to the optimal solution.
